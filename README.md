# PostgreSQL course tasks

This repository contains SQL exercises organized by complexity level:

## Complexity Levels

1. **Very Simple (1_Y_)**: Basic SQL operations (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE)
2. **Simple (2_Y_)**: Basic operations plus simple filtering, sorting, and aggregation
3. **Medium (3_Y_)**: Joins, subqueries, more complex filtering and aggregation
4. **Advanced (4_Y_)**: Multiple joins, complex subqueries, window functions, CTEs
5. **Very Advanced (5_Y_)**: Database normalization, complex data modeling, advanced optimization

Files are prefixed with both their complexity level and an inner ordering number (e.g., "2_3_crypt_exch.sql" where 2 is the complexity level and 3 is the inner ordering number within that level).

The naming convention follows the format "X_Y_filename.sql" where:
- X: Complexity level (1-5)
- Y: Inner ordering number (starting from 1)

This organization allows you to progress through exercises in a structured way, both across complexity levels and within each level.
